- Maybe implement DB::BulkDeleteForRange(start_key, end_key)
  that would blow away files whose ranges are entirely contained
  within [start_key..end_key]?  For Chrome, deletion of obsolete
  object stores, etc. can be done in the background anyway, so
  probably not that important.
- There have been requests for MultiGet.

After a range is completely deleted, what gets rid of the
corresponding files if we do no future changes to that range.  Make
the conditions for triggering compactions fire in more situations?

Implementation of WiscKey:

Step 1: For any Write, change Value to expected content, and supports for read.

Step 2: Think the organization of value file.

Step 3: For a vptr, supports for read from a file.

Step 4: Combination of all above step to accomplish WiscKey.
